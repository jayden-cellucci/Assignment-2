    <p id= "boole"> George Boole was an English mathematician philosopher and logician.</p>
    <p id= "occupancy">  He is known for establishing symolic algebra and algebra of logic (now called Boolean Logic) which is the basic desgin to computer circuts.</p>
    <h2> Early Life </h2>
    <p>Boole was born in Lincoln Enlgand on November 2, 1815. He learned mathematics threw his father but was mostly self-taught on-ward.</p> 
    <p>By 16, he was teaching in village schools in West Yorkshire and opened his own school by age 20.</p>
    <br>
    <h2> The Law of Thoughts (1854) and Boolean Logic</h2>
    <p>In 1849 Boole was appointed the first professeor of mathematics at Queen's College in Cork Ireland. In 1854, he publsihed "An Investigation into the Law of Thoughts."</p>
    <p> The book was only 86 pages long but was straightforward with Boole using alegbra to represent logic, this became known as "Boolean Logic".</p>
    <p>Boole talked about the analogy between algebraic symbols and those that can represent logical forms and syllogisms, showing how the symbols of quantity can be separated from those of operation.</p>
    <p> Boole was also one of the first Englishmen to write on logic. </p>
    <br> 
    <h2> Death </h2>
   <p> Boole contracted pneumonia on November 24, 1864 and died two weeks later on Dec 8, he was 49. </p>
    <p id= booole><q>It is not of the essence of mathematics to be conversant with the ideas of number and quantity. Whether as a general habit of mind it would be desirable to apply symbolic processes to moral argument, is another question.</q></p>
